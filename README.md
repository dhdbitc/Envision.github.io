# "Tuning into your tastes": Exploring popular song features and trends
___

## Executive Summary:


## Motivation:
Streaming services have brought about a significant transformation in the music industry, offering users convenient and cost-effective access to a vast catalog of songs. These services play a pivotal role in shaping artist visibility, revenue streams, and listening preferences. Moreover, the publicly available APIs provided by streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and Amazon Music offer unparalleled insights into various dimensions, including geography, audio features, and time, shedding light on trends among both artists and listeners.<br>
<br>
Throughout our project, we embarked with a set of guiding questions:<br>
* What are the most popular audio features, and how have they evolved over time?<br>
* How has the popularity of artists changed over time?<br>
* Is there a correlation between the evolution of audio features among top artists and the overall trends in popular music?<br>
<br>
While not all of these questions fell strictly within the scope of our analysis, they served as initial guiding points. Ultimately, our deep passion for music and curiosity propelled us to undertake this project, as we sought personal enjoyment and a deeper understanding of the subject matter.
